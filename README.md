A collection of Unity packages demonstrating game mechanics and use cases for Unity Visual Scripting (previously known as Bolt), which is now native to the editor as of Unity 2021.1.

__All samples can be found in this repo's [Releases section](https://github.com/avashly/unity-visualscripting-samples/releases) and are intended for the built-in version of Visual Scripting available in Unity versions 2021.1 and above.__ Similar projects compatible with the Asset Store version of Visual Scripting (for Unity versions 2018.1 - 2020.3) can be found over on [Unity-Bolt-Samples](https://github.com/avashly/Unity-Bolt-Samples).

## Setup

The easiest way to get started:

1. Download one of the Unity Visual Scripting Samples from the [Releases section](https://github.com/avashly/unity-visualscripting-samples/releases).

2. Use the [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html) to open a new Unity 2021.1 (currently in Beta) project and make sure to follow any unique setup requirements listed for your selected sample.

3. In the Unity menu bar, navigate to Assets > Import Package > Custom Package & select the package you downloaded earlier to import it into your project. After this, you're all set!
